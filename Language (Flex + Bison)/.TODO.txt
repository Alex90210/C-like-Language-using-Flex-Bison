What else if left to do?

FIX : why do frame functions not store parameters?

1. - return function values, evaluate function calls
2. - make if/while actually work
3. - make string assignments not break the program

What works well:

1. Checking the types of function calls.
2. Checking that the right part of an expression is made up from the same types.
3. Duplicate declaration check.
4. If an expr has different types the value will not be stored in the table, in an initialization
5. Arithmetic/bool evaluations
6. Evals for method members, array types, expressions

Limitations: 

2. Functions/methods can't return values yet.
